## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

i have learn difference between relative , absolute and fixed position , and how to set their widths. i also learned how 
create forms in the html.
At the end, i believe i did a good job with the things that i used.
Always open to any comments

```html
<div class="form__input">
                <p>
                    <label for="firstName">FIRST NAME</label><br>
                    <input type="text" name="firstName" id="firstName" placeholder="myla" autocomplete="on" required autofocus>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <label for="lastName">LAST NAME</label><br>
                    <input type="text" name="lastName" id="lastName" placeholder="" autocomplete="on" required>
                </p>
               

            </div>
```
```css
 .left__side {
    position: relative;
    width: 100%;
    background-color: black;
    background-image: url(img/pexels-lisa-fotios-1068866.jpg);
    object-fit: contain;
   
    
}
```

### Continued development

i think as a software developer you will always have to create different types of form and starting to build now
will help me build a strong fondation. 

### Useful resources

- [html form element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) - This helped me to understand better how to come out with a good form.
